Akka messaging retries
-----------------------

This Scala/Akka project shows a concept for retrying messages.

Instead of supervising actors and restarting them, you can also resend failed work.

In this example the ServiceActor calls a UnreliableResource, which will randomly fail.
In the onFailure callback for the Future, the orignal message is propagated back to the sender as FailedWork.
When receiving FailedWork, the caller/parent will resend it as a new message.

The main app is AkkaRetriesApp.
This will bootstrap the application by sending a start message to the Orchestrator.
Using routing the service(s) will be receiving work, which fail or succeed.
